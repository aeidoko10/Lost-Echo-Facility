# Lost Hope 

Lost hope is a quake level map which is set in an abandoned church which is rumored to have a facility below it with which it was doing inhuman experiments on the recipients of the church. "You" the player have been tasked with solving the horror that lurk underneath the churchs very foundation which have been buried below. It couldn't be that bad, right?
